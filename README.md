Hi Tiago,

Lets make you background image 100% responsive for all devices. I will use the most demanding approach of css to make your background image and logo responsive. Here's how:

ðŸŸ¢ I will use flexbox to adjust the whole screen width.

ðŸŸ¢ I will use background position properties in percentage to be responsive for each breakpoint.

ðŸŸ¢ I will set the logo width in percentage according to the screen to adjust the logo on each breakpoint screen.

I have experience in web development and have worked on making websites responsive. I can definitely help you with this task.

you can check my previous work.
